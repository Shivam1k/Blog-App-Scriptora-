🚀 Execution Flow in Next.js (App Router)

Here’s how it runs step-by-step when someone visits /dashboard:
1. Route matched

When user visits /dashboard, Next.js matches:

    app/dashboard/page.tsx

    Wraps it inside:

        app/layout.tsx (global)

        app/dashboard/layout.tsx (section-specific)

2. Server Components Rendered First

By default, page.tsx, layout.tsx, and components without "use client" are server components, rendered on the server.

    So your BlogDashboard fetches articles using prisma – on the server – before it gets sent to the client.

3. Client Components Hydrated on Client

Components with "use client" (like your LeftSidebar, RecentArticles, etc.) are:

    Rendered initially as HTML on the server

    Then hydrated (made interactive) on the client using React

4. Suspense and Loading UI

If a page/component is loading data or code split chunks:

    Next.js shows app/loading.tsx automatically as a fallback

    Works with useTransition and Suspense

5. Dynamic Routing

A route like dashboard/articles/[id]/edit/page.tsx gets:

    The article id from the URL (via params)

    Uses it to fetch the correct article and show edit form

6. Server Actions (like deleteArticle)

You use:

<form action={() => deleteArticle(articleId)}>

    This runs entirely on the server

    deleteArticle() lives in actions/delete-article.ts

    No API route needed — it’s a native server action

⚡ Recap: Code Flow in Next.js App Router

User navigates →
 → Next.js finds route
 → Loads server components (fetches data)
 → Wraps in layout.tsx(s)
 → Sends HTML to browser
 → Hydrates client components ("use client")
 → Interactions (click, form) use server actions or client state

Absolutely, Shivam! Let’s break down how Suspense and loading.tsx work in Next.js App Router, especially in the context of server-rendered pages and async operations.
⚙️ 4. Suspense and loading.tsx in Next.js – Full Explanation
🔄 The Problem It Solves:

When you're rendering a page that fetches data on the server, or lazily loads components, it can take time. You don’t want a blank screen while it loads.

Next.js solves this by:

    Automatically wrapping your pages/layouts in a React Suspense boundary

    Showing a loading.tsx while the data/code is still loading

💡 Basic Rule:

If your route has async work (e.g. Prisma calls) and takes time to resolve, ➡️ Next.js will automatically look for and render a loading.tsx file in the same folder.
🧠 Example: Folder Structure

app/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── page.tsx          # Server component with async prisma fetch
│   ├── loading.tsx       # Shown while page.tsx is loading

🧵 What Happens:

    User visits /dashboard

    dashboard/page.tsx fetches articles with Prisma (server-side)

    While it's fetching: ✅ dashboard/loading.tsx is rendered

    Once data arrives: ✅ dashboard/page.tsx replaces the loading screen

💻 Code Example
app/dashboard/page.tsx

import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"

const DashboardPage = async () => {
  const articles = await prisma.articles.findMany()
  return <div>Loaded Dashboard with {articles.length} articles</div>
}

export default DashboardPage

app/dashboard/loading.tsx

const Loading = () => {
  return <div className="p-4 text-gray-500">Loading dashboard...</div>
}

export default Loading

Result:

    While the articles are being fetched, the Loading component is shown.

⚙️ Bonus: useTransition + Suspense (on client side)

Sometimes you want to defer rendering something on the client side while a transition is happening.
✨ useTransition lets you mark state updates as low priority

const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

<Button
  onClick={() =>
    startTransition(() => {
      router.push("/dashboard")
    })
  }
>
  Go to Dashboard
</Button>

⏳ Combine with <Suspense>:

You can also wrap slow-loading components with Suspense:

<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <SomeComponentThatTakesTime />
</Suspense>

But you usually only need this manually for client-side lazy components. Server components already benefit from loading.tsx.
✅ Summary
Feature	What it Does	Where it's Used
loading.tsx	Auto fallback UI while server page/layout is loading	Same folder as page.tsx or layout.tsx
useTransition	Defers state updates / navigation	Client components
<Suspense>	Shows a fallback during async/lazy loading	Often for client lazy imports
